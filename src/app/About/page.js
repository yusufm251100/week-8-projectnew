        The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes called the koala bear, is
        an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only
        extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae. Its closest living
        relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the
        island's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South
        Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by its
        stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large,
        dark nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs
        4–15 kg (8.8–33.1 lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate
        brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and
        lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These
        populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed.
